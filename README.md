Hi I am Harish Bhupalam

From Analytics to Social Issues, from Architecture to Economy,
I have a passion for learning across diverse fields. I am a versatile individual pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence,
eager to apply analytics and machine learning to solve problems.

As an Analyst, I have applied statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms
to derive meaningful insights from complex data, enabling firms to make informed business decisions.

As a teaching assistant, I have explained statistical topics clearly and effectively,
helping students grasp complex concepts, which has refined my ability to communicate data-driven insights.

As a mentor and content developer, I have guided and evaluated aspirants
for the civil services and Reserve Bank of India recruitment exams,
using analytics to assess performance and provide targeted feedback, giving me a broader understanding of various issues.

As an architect, I applied data analysis for project planning and cost optimization,
and worked with multiple firms and individuals.
My experience in site management and coordination has honed my organizational and leadership skills,
anchored in data-driven decision making.

I am keen on bringing my diverse skill sets and experience to analytics and data science positions
where I can leverage data to drive meaningful impacts.
